# Lab-06

Project Name

**Author**: Nadya Ilinskaya & Hanna Alemu
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. Working with a new partner each day, you will request data from a total of six third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. In labs 8 and 9, you will be persisting data in a SQL database.

For this lab assignment, we will convert a location entered by the user into a latitude and longitude, then use those values to request weather information for that location. As your City Explorer back end progresses in labs 6 through 9, you will use the latitude and longitude to request information from other APIs from the same search query.

## Getting Started
For this lab we will use two provided JSON files to extract data using the server.js file. 
## Architecture
We will use constructor functions to create output objects that follow the same patern. These constructor functions take in a user's query request and display data that gets recieved from the JSON files.
## Change Log
7/16/2019 1:00pm
Fully functioning directory with all required files and sub-directories, server.JS contains constructor functions that display results of location and weather requests.
